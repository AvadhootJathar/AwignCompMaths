Code for Computational Maths Use Cases - Awign

The repository contains pieces of code illustrating use of a few Mathematics concepts (notably from linear algebra and optimization) for specific data science use cases.

1. I illustrate concept of Multicollinearity with lack of identification for a perfectly correlated predictor in linear regression in Pgr1_OLS_first_principle.R. This also suggests use of variable selection methods like LASSO and Ridge regression for multicollinear system.
2. In Pgr2_large_scale_data_regression.R, I illustrate computational ease of using QR decomposition in estimating linear regression
3. In Pgr3_principal_components_image.py, I explain the use of principal components using SVD, for dimensionality reduction with images data
