Code for Computational Maths Use Cases - Awign
The repository contains pieces of code illustrating use of a few Mathematics concepts (notably from linear algebra and optimization) for specific data science use cases.
I illustrate concept of Multicollinearity with lack of identification for a perfectly correlated predictor in linear regression in program1.R
In program2.R, I illustrate computational ease of using QR decomposition in estimating linear regression
In program3.R, I explain the use of principal components using SVD, for dimensionality reduction with images data
